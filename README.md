# Unit 1 - Asphalt Art

## Introduction

Cities use asphalt art to improve public safety, inspire their residents and visitors, and brighten communities. Your goal is to create asphalt art to revitalize The Neighborhood and bring the community together with the help of the Painter.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, algorithms, the problem solving process, and decomposition strategies to create asphalt art:
- **Create a new subclass** – Create at least one new subclass of the PainterPlus class that is used for a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Plan an algorithm** – Use the problem solving process and decomposition strategies to plan an algorithm that incorporates a combination of sequencing, selection, and/or iteration.
- **Write a method** – Write at least one method in a PainterPlus subclass that contributes to a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments.

## Notes: Neighborhood & Painter Class

This project was created on Code.org's JavaLab platform using the built in Neightborhood GUI output. To test and edit this project you must build in Code.org's JavaLab with the Neighborhood GUI enabled. For reference to the Painter class documentation, [you can read more here.](https://studio.code.org/docs/ide/javalab/classes/Painter)

## Reflection

1. Describe your project.

   - My project surrounds a ladybug laying in a grass field. It is created using three different painters I instantiated. The first one is named Briana and she is a Mural Painter, I used her to paint the background of the project green. The second painter is named Anthony and he is a Ladybug Painter , I used him to paint the body of the ladybug red and the dots and ears of the ladybug in black. The third one is named Ginger and she is also a Ladybug Painter that I used to paint the legs of the lady bug. I created four different methods named startPostion, paintBody, paintLegs, and paintEars to help move the painters. The new subclasses I created are LadybugPainter and MuralPainter that extend the PainterPlus class. 

2. What are two things about your project that you are proud of?

   - I am proud of the code I wrote during the program specifically the startPosition method because I will be able to use thisi method in other projects to help set my painters starting position. I also really like the accuracy of my ladybug painting and how even though I could have choosen a more simple image I decided to do something a little different to challenge myself. Overall I am proud that I was able to develop and write the code without any external assisstance. 

3. Describe something you would improve or do differently if you had an opportunity to change something about your project.

   - If I could do something differently to improve my project I would find out a way to move multiple times by writing it like move(3) to move 3 times in the direction the painter is facing rather than having to repeat the code multiple times. I believe this would help shorten my lines of code and make it less repetitive.
