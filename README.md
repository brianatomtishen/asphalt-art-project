## Reflection

1. Describe your project.

   - My project surrounds a ladybug laying in a grass field. It is created using three different painters I instantiated. The first one is named Briana and she is a Mural Painter, I used her to paint the background of the project green. The second painter is named Anthony and he is a Ladybug Painter , I used him to paint the body of the ladybug red and the dots and ears of the ladybug in black. The third one is named Ginger and she is also a Ladybug Painter that I used to paint the legs of the lady bug. I created four different methods named startPostion, paintBody, paintLegs, and paintEars to help move the painters. The new subclasses I created are LadybugPainter and MuralPainter that extend the PainterPlus class. 

2. What are two things about your project that you are proud of?

   - I am proud of the code I wrote during the program specifically the startPosition method because I will be able to use thisi method in other projects to help set my painters starting position. I also really like the accuracy of my ladybug painting and how even though I could have choosen a more simple image I decided to do something a little different to challenge myself. Overall I am proud that I was able to develop and write the code without any external assisstance. 

3. Describe something you would improve or do differently if you had an opportunity to change something about your project.

   - If I could do something differently to improve my project I would find out a way to move multiple times by writing it like move(3) to move 3 times in the direction the painter is facing rather than having to repeat the code multiple times. I believe this would help shorten my lines of code and make it less repetitive.
